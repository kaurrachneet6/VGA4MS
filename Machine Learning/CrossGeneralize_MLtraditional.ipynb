    "### Traditional ML algorithms on task+subject generalization together frameworks, namely a) train on some subjects in W-> test on separate set of subjects in WT and b) train on some subjects in VBW-> test on separate set of subjects in VBWT to classify HOA/MS/PD strides and subjects \n",
    "#### Remember to add the original count of frames in a single stride (before down sampling via smoothing) for each stride as an additional artificial feature to add information about speed of the subject to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Save the optimal hyperparameters, confusion matrices and ROC curves for each algorithm.\n",
    "2. Make sure to not use x, y, z, confidence = 0, 0, 0, 0 as points for the model since they are simply missing values and not data points, so make sure to treat them before inputting to model \n",
    "3. Make sure to normalize (z-score normalization) the features before we feed them to the model.\n",
    "4. We use the summary statistics as range, CoV and asymmetry between the right and left limbs as the features to input to the traditional models requiring fixed size 1D input for each training/testing set sample.\n",
    "5. For implementation of task+subject generalization together framework 1: i.e. train on some subjects in W and test on remaining separate set of subjects in WT,  since we have 32 subjects in training/W and 26 subjects in testing/WT and 25 subjects that are common in both W and WT. We always keep the (32-25) = 7 subjects only available in W in training and always keep (26-25) = 1 subject only available in WT in testing along with cross validation folds created for training and testing sets from the 25 common subjects in both. So, basically, for 5 fold cross validation on 25 common subjects, we train on 20 + 7 subjects and test on 5+1 subjects where these 20 and 5 subjects keep on changing with each fold, but the 7 and 1 subjects remain the same.\n",
    "6. We use stratified group 5 fold cross validation."
